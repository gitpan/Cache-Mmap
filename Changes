    an already existing entry
    Thanks to Rob Mueller for the test case

  Fixed serious bug in read(), which didn't update the current bucket content
    size when expiring entries. This caused infinite loops in _find() and
    _insert(), which have also been fixed, should anything else ever go wrong
    in a similar way

2000-09-18 0.01, First release
  Only lock file header in _lock(0), rather than whole file
  Factor out code from read() and write() into _insert()
  Only delete clean items from underlying data in delete()
  Add documentation, including README

  Mostly finish write()
  Fix bug where 'use integer' interfered with safe bucketsize calculation

  Write pushed out items to underlying data when new items read in
    This caused the file format to change
  Add delete()
  Start work on write()
