=head1 NAME

Cache::Mmap - Shared data cache using memory mapped files

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Cache::Mmap;

  $cache=Cache::Mmap->new($filename,\%options);

  $val1=$cache->read($key1);
  $cache->write($key2,$val2);
  $cache->delete($key3);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module implements a shared data cache, using memory mapped files.
If routines are provided which interact with the underlying data, access to
the cache is completely transparent, and the module handles all the details of
refreshing cache contents, and updating underlying data, if necessary.

Cache entries are assigned to "buckets" within the cache file, depending on
the key. Within each bucket, entries are stored approximately in order of last
access, so that frequently accessed entries will move to the head of the
bucket, thus decreasing access time. Concurrent accesses to the same bucket are
prevented by file locking of the relevant section of the cache file.

=head1 CLASS METHODS

=over

=item new($filename,\%options)

Creates a new cache object. If the file named by C<$filename> does not already
exist, it will be created. If the cache object cannot be created for any
reason, an exception will be thrown. Various options may be set in C<%options>,
which affect the behaviour of the cache (defaults in parentheses):

=over 4

=item permissions (0600)

Sets the file permissions for the cache file if it doesn't already exist.

=item buckets (13)

Sets the number of buckets inside the cache file. A larger number of buckets
will give better performance for a cache with many accesses, as there will be
less chance of concurrent access to the same bucket.

=item bucketsize (1024)

Sets the size of each bucket, in bytes. A larger bucket size will be needed to
store large cache entries. If the bucketsize is not large enough to hold a
particular entry, it will still be passed between the underlying data and the
application in its entirety, but will not be stored in the cache.

=item pagesize (1024)

Sets the alignment of buckets within the file. The file header will be extended
to this size, and bucket sizes will be rounded up to the nearest multiple.
Choosing a pagesize equal to the virtual memory page size of the host system
should improve performance.

=item strings (0)

If true, cache entries are treated as strings, rather than references. This
will help performance for string-only caches, as no time will be taken to
serialize cache entries.

=item expiry (0)

If non-zero, sets the length of time, in seconds, which cache entries are
considered valid. A new entry will be fetched from the underlying data if
an expired cache entry would otherwise have been returned.

=item context (undef)

This value is passed to the read/write/delete routines below, to provide
context. This will typically be a database handle, used to fetch data from.

=item read (undef)

Provides a code reference to a routine which will fetch entries from the
underlying data. Called as C<$read-E<gt>($key,$context)>, this routine should
return a list C<($found,$value)>, where C<$found> is true if the entry could
be found in the underlying data, and C<$value> is the value to cache.

If the routine only returns a single scalar, that will be taken as
the value, and C<$found> will be set to true if the value is defined.

If this routine is not provided, only values already in the cache will ever
be returned.

There are currently two special values of C<$found> which cause slightly
different behaviour. These are constants which may be imported in the
C<use> statement.

=over 4

=item C<Cache::Mmap::CMM_keep_expired>

Use the previously cached value, even if it has expired. This is useful if
the underlying data source has become unavailable for some reason. Note that
even though the value returned will be ignored in this case, it must be
returned to avoid C<$found> being interpreted as a single scalar:

  return (Cache::Mmap::CMM_keep_expired, undef);

=item C<Cache::Mmap::CMM_keep_expired_refresh>

This causes the same behaviour as C<CMM_keep_expired>, but the cache entry's
expiry time will be reset as if a value had been successfully read from the
underlying data.

=back

=item cachenegative (0)

If true, even unsuccessful fetches from the underlying data are cached. This
can be useful to only search the underlying data once for each required key.

=item write (undef)

Provides a code reference to a routine which will write cache entries into the
underlying data. This routine will be called by write(), to synchronise the
underlying data with the cache. Called as C<$write-E<gt>($key,$val,$context)>.
If the routine is not provided, the underlying data will not be synchronised
after cache writes.

=item writethrough (1)

If true, the C<write> routine above will be called as soon as
write() is called. This provides immediate synchronisation of
underlying data and cache contents.

If false, the C<write> routine will
be called for each cache entry which no longer fits in its bucket after a
cache read or write. This provides a write-as-necessary behaviour, which may
be more efficient than the writethrough behaviour. However, only data fetched
through the cache will reflect these changes.

=item delete (undef)

Provides a code reference to a routine which will delete items from the
underlying data. This routine will be called by delete(),
to synchronise the underlying data with the cache. Called as
C<$delete-E<gt>($key,$cval,$context)>, where C<$cval> is the value
currently stored in the cache. If this routine is not provided, entries
deleted from the cache have no effect on the underlying data.

=back

An alternative to supplying a C<write> routine, is to call
delete() after updating the underlying data. Note however, that
in the case of databases, this should be done after committing the update, so
that a concurrent process doesn't reload the cache between being the entry
being deleted, and the database updates being committed.

=item entries()

=item entries(0)

Returns a list of the keys of entries held in the cache. Note that this list
may be immediately out of date, due to the shared nature of the cache. Entries
may be added or removed by other processes between this list being generated
and when it is used.

=item entries(1)

Returns a list of hashrefs representing entries held in the cache. The
following keys are present in each hashref:

  key    The key used to identify the entry
  time   The time the entry was stored (seconds since the epoch)
  dirty  Whether the entry needs writing to the underlying data

The same caveat applies to the currency of this information as above.
