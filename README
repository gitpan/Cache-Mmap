This module provides a shared cache, using a memory mapped file. Very useful
for mod_perl applications. If routines are provided which interact with the
underlying data, access to the cache is completely transparent, and the module
handles all the details of refreshing cache contents, and updating underlying
data, if necessary.

Changes between versions 0.07 and 0.08
  Add CMM_keep_expired and CMM_keep_expired_refresh flags to enable temporary
    underlying data availability problems to be dealt with nicely
  Thanks to Jeffey Friedl <jfriedl@yahoo.com>
    for the idea and initial implementation
  Document quick_clear()

Changes between versions 0.05 and 0.07
  Add a check for super-sized entries (those which extend past the bucket end)
  Make zero-sized check message include cache filename and key
  Add t/03corrupt.t to check that the corruption checks are working
  Deal with utf8 properly (and add t/04utf8.t)
    This changes the file format, so added format version number to file header
  Existing files which aren't cache files are not overwritten
