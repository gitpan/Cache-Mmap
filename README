This module provides a shared cache, using a memory mapped file. Very useful
for mod_perl applications. If routines are provided which interact with the
underlying data, access to the cache is completely transparent, and the module
handles all the details of refreshing cache contents, and updating underlying
data, if necessary.

Changes since version 0.01
  Fixed serious bug in read(), which didn't update the current bucket content
    size when expiring entries. This caused infinite loops in _find() and
    _insert(), which have also been fixed, should anything else ever go wrong
    in a similar way
