clear(), like quick_clear(), but flushing dirty entries

Untaint values read from file in _set_options() (see email)
	Actually, only the header values should be untainted
	Cache entries should be tainted

Make thread-safe

Factor common code out of read() and write()

Improve test suite

Another good idea from Rob Mueller:

	Store pointer table at beginning of bucket, and just swap pointers
	Only move entries when deleting entries
	What about backwards compatibility?
